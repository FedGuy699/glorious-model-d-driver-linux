Glorious Model D- driver
Description

I got bored and made this driver for the Glorious Model D- USB mouse. Why? Because, why not? it out performs the standard linux mouse drivers with about 650 hz polling rate 

I’m not sure if anyone else will find this useful, but here it is. It works with Linux, so if you're running Ubuntu, Arch, or whatever else you use, it should work fine (assuming you have the right libraries, of course).
Features

    USB-based driver—just plug and play (hopefully).

    Doesn't completely suck (I think).

Usage

Run the driver:

    sudo ./driver &

When you’re ready to stop using it, just unplug your mouse and plug it back in. This will reset it to the default Glorious Model D- driver.

Requirements

    A Glorious Model D- mouse (obviously).

    Linux (Tested on Linux Mint, might work on others).

License

    Do whatever you want with it. I’m not going to stop you.
